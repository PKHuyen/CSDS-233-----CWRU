# CSDS-233-----CWRU
This is my coding and written assignment for CSDS 233: Data Structures and Algorithms, taught by Dr. Erman Ayday.
Course Description:
Different representations of data: lists, stacks and queues, trees, graphs, and files. Manipulation of data: searching and sorting, hashing, recursion and higher order functions. Abstract data types, templating, and the separation of interface and implementation. Introduction to asymptotic analysis. The Java language is used to illustrate the concepts and as an implementation vehicle throughout the course.
